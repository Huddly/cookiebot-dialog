# How to install

**After installing Cookiebot on your website, following [these instructions](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/help/), you can install this repo following these steps:**

Because Cookiebot doesn't support new CSS properties, you will manually need to include the css file in your project.

```bash
npm install Huddly/cookiebot-dialog --save
```

Then import the following styling in your project:

```javascript
import '@huddly/cookiebot-dialog/dist/dialog.css';
```

In the same `@huddly/cookiebot-dialog/dist/` folder you will find the following files:

-   `dialog.html`
-   `dialog.js`

Paste the content of these into your cookiebot dialog setting fields after selecting the "Custom dialog" option.

After this, your Cookiebot dialog should look like this:
